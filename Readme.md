# 🤖 IntroductionToRobotics 2023-2024

Hey there, in my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest, I've been diving deep into the world of Robotics 🚀. Our coursework involves hands-on laboratory and assignments with intricate specifications. We get to work with real-world challenges, which is not only educational but also genuinely interesting.

## Table of Contents
- 📝 Homework 1: This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of an RGB LED using individual potentiometers. (This is still a work in progress. I might provide an anchor to the existing content instead of linking to the directory.)

## 🌐🛠️📊 Homework 5
### 🎯Task:
In this project, the central theme was the development of a "Smart Environment Monitor and Logger" using Arduino, featuring an Ultrasonic Sensor and an LDR (Photocell). The system has been enhanced with the incorporation of multiple thresholds, demonstrating its ability to operate effectively. Through these thresholds, the system showcases a dynamic response, providing visual feedback via an RGB LED. Additionally, user interaction is facilitated through a Serial Menu, adding a layer of versatility to the monitoring and logging capabilities.
