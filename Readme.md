# 🤖 IntroductionToRobotics 2023-2024

Hey there, in my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest, I've been diving deep into the world of Robotics 🚀. Our coursework involves hands-on laboratory and assignments with intricate specifications. We get to work with real-world challenges, which is not only educational but also genuinely interesting.
